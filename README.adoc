The networkd-broker is an event broker daemon for systemd-networkd.
It will execute scripts in the `/etc/networkd/broker.d/<STATE>.d` directory in alphabetical order in response to network events.

toc::[]

This work is based on https://gitlab.com/craftyguy/networkd-dispatcher[networkd-dispatcher], written in Rust, for the purpose of reducing runtime dependencies.
This also helps reduce memory footprint (~30MB &longrightarrow;
~8MB) and improve startup time (~30secs ⟶ ~1sec for spinning hard disk drive).

== Installation

=== Arch Linux

It is available on AUR as https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/networkd-broker/[networkd-broker].
To build and install arch package from GIT source:

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/bpetlert/networkd-broker.git
$ cd networkd-broker
$ makepkg -p PKGBUILD.local
$ pacman -U networkd-broker-xxxx-1-x86_64.pkg.tar
----

Then enable/start networkd-broker.service

[source,shell]
----
$ systemctl enable networkd-broker.service
$ systemctl start networkd-broker.service
----

== Configuration

To change the options of networkd-broker service, run `systemctl edit networkd-broker.service`

./etc/systemd/system/networkd-broker.service.d/override.conf
[source,ini]
----
[Service]
Environment='NETWORKD_BROKER_ARGS=-vv --json'
----

Supported options are:

* `-j`, `--json` Pass JSON encoding of event and link status to script.
* `-T`, `--run-startup-triggers` Generate events reflecting preexisting state and behavior on startup.
* `-v`, `--verbose` Increment verbosity level once per call.
Default is showing error.
** `-v`: warn
** `-vv`: info
** `-vvv`: debug
** `-vvvv`: trace
* `-S`, `--script-dir <script_dir>` Location under which to look for scripts.
The default location is `/etc/networkd/broker.d`.
* `-t`, `--timeout <timeout>` Script execution timeout in seconds.
Default is 20 seconds.

== Usage

The scripts for any network event need to be putted (or symlink) in its corresponding directory as shown below.
Each script must be a regular executable file owned by root.
The default execution timeout of each script is 20 seconds.
It can be overridden by `--timeout` option in service configuration.
Any of the scripts which end with '-nowait' is run immediately, without waitting for the termination of previous scripts.

    ├── off.d
    ├── routable.d
    └── unmanaged.d
----

The scripts are run in alphabetical order, one at a time with two arguments and a set of environment variables being passed.
Each script run asynchronously from `networkd-broker` process.

|===
| Argument | Description

| `STATE`
| Current link status is one of the following: `carrier`, `configured`, `configuring`, `degraded`, `dormant`, `linger`, `no-carrier`, `off`, `routable`, `unmanaged`;
see `man networkctl` for more details.

| `IFACE`
| Link name that operation just happened on
|===

The following environment variables are being passed to each script:

|===
| Variable | Description

| `NWD_DEVICE_IFACE`
| Link name that operation just happened on, same value as `IFACE`

| `NWD_BROKER_ACTION`
| Current link status, same value as `STATE`

| `NWD_ESSID`
| SSID of access point if link is wireless

| `NWD_STATION`
| MAC address of associated access point

| `NWD_IP4_ADDRESS`
| Current IPv4 address

| `NWD_IP6_ADDRESS`
| Current IPv6 address

| `NWD_ADMINISTRATIVE_STATE`
| Current operation;
see `man networkctl` for more details.

| `NWD_LINK_STATE`
| Current operation;
see `man networkctl` for more details.

| `NWD_JSON`
| All the environment variables above are encoded in JSON format if `--json` option is setted in service configuration.
|===

=== Example script

The script below activate/deactivate https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chrony[Chrony] correspond to link state of `wlp3s0` link.
This script must be put (or symlink) in `/etc/networkd/broker.d/routable.d`, `/etc/networkd/broker.d/configured.d`, and `/etc/networkd/broker.d/no-carrier.d`.

.chrony-switch
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh

STATE=$1
IFACE=$2

if [ $IFACE != "wlp3s0" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

if [ "$STATE" = "routable" ] || [ "$STATE" = "configured" ]; then
  chronyc online > /dev/null
  chronyc burst 4/4 > /dev/null
  sleep 10
  chronyc makestep > /dev/null
  echo "Activate chrony"
elif [ "$STATE" = "no-carrier" ]; then
  chronyc offline > /dev/null
  echo "Deactivate chrony"
fi
